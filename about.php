      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>This website was built as an entry to the 2016 Riot Games API Challenge in the category Usability/Practicality.</p>
      <p>This year the challenge was to create a piece of software that utilizes Champion Mastery data, so we decided to create a website where you could search for a summoner's champion mastery, where you can see detailed info about it, aswell as comparing it to another summoner (Ex.: Comparing your stats with your friend stats or comparing a pro player stats with another pro player stats); In our website you can also check the leaderboards that contain the community general highest scores aswell as individual champion highest scores.</p>
