# Masterdinger

Masterdinger is an online platform which allows Summoners to see their detailed information about their Mastery Points.
It also uses that data to compare them to other Summoners from all around the world in a Leaderboard.
A Summoner may also choose to compare himself to another Summoner.

In this documentation we will explain how it works and why it excels at doing its job.

#Installation

Masterdinger.com is going to be running on a Debian 8 Server with PHP 7.0.
These are the packages needed:
php7.0 php7.0-mysql php7.0-curl php7.0-json apache2

PHP 7.0 is not yet available in Debian Jessie's repositories, so I added this one:
deb http://packages.dotdeb.org jessie all
